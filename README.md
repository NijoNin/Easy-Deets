# Easy Deets
Easy deets meaning easy details.

A single page PWA (progressive web app) that generates a QR code dynamically for easy access to your website, portfolio, details, etc.

I created this using replit for free hosting. Working link to webapp is here: [Easy Deets](https://easy-deets.nijonin.repl.co/)

# Why?
Isn't this just the same as other QR generators? Why make another?

I had the idea that because I am moving to Japan and I dont have a business card, why dont I make a webapp that I can use to map to my useless bixby button. I wanted it easily accessible to ~~all~~ most browsers and specifically chrome on android as I wanted to install the webapp via chrome browser. This meant it acted like an app to link to the bixby button natively. 

I wanted to make a QR code generator that looked simple and nice but was also nice to show someone your QR code with ease. 

# Updates and Features

I will be updating this when I can to add certain features I want.

The features or updates that may be added in the future are:

 - Custom colors via Hex code
 - Inverted QR/BG color mode
 - Better Cache integration for PWA
 - Secret easter egg??
